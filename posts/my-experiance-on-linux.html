            <h3>My experiance on Linux.</h3>
            <p>I used windows for the most part of life. I didn't have any single complaint back then when I was using it. But later on I got bored using windows.
                 I don't know the exact facts, but I think it's mainly due to lack of customization. I decided to give Linux a try. I did some research and fully installed 
                 POP OS, which is a distro based on Ubuntu. I had hard time configuring it to my likings. It wasn't easy, coming from Windows and using POP OS as my daily drive.
                 Since there aren't any limitations, One can adjust almost everything to his preferences. Once get used to it, it was my SAFE ZONE.
