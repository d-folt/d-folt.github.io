            <h3>5 seond rule.</h3>
            <p>I&#39;ve been dealing with procrastination lately. bitter truth is I enjoy procrastinating but it also makes you feel guilty.
                 Knowing that you need to do work but instead you choose to chill around. 
                 I came across a method called <strong>5 second rule</strong> and what it does basically is limiting your thoughts and let the action carry on, 
                 without thinking consequences. I&#39;ve been putting this into practice and had some real results. You can try it too.
